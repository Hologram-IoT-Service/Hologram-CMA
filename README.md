# [Hologram-CMA](https://hologram-iot-service.github.io/Hologram-CMA/)
ðŸŒŒ Hologram Elas central management application for controling the IoT core systems.

### Build Status
![Android CI](https://github.com/Hologram-IoT-Service/Hologram-CMA/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg)

### Download
[![jitpack](https://jitpack.io/v/Hologram-IoT-Service/Hologram-CMA.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Hologram-IoT-Service/Hologram-CMA) <br>
Here is the `jarvis-data` model library that used as common thrid-party library. <br>
This library is used in `Holohram-CMA` and `Holohram-Hardware-core` project. <br>

#### Step1
Add the JitPack repository to your build file. <br>
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
#### Step2
Add the dependency.
```gradle
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.Hologram-IoT-Service:Hologram-CMA:1.0.0'
}
```

### How to use?
This CMA library provides below `DatabaseReference` extensions.
```kotlin
// send `turn on` command to the Elsa-Heart.
ledTurnOn()

// send `turn off` command to the Elsa-Heart.
ledTurnOff()

// send a customized message to the Elsa-Heart.
// the message format is composed with name (tag) and the message.
// Elsa-heart will be get this message and process based on the message information.
sendMessage(name: String, message: String)
```

#### getFireBaseMessage
We can get pre-existed message string type from a sentence using the `getFireBaseMessage` method.<br>
If a sentence includes any pre-existed word string, we can get processed command message as a String type.
```kotin
if (getFireBaseMessage(command) == command.trim()) {
     toast("query : $result")
     queryServer(command)
}
```

#### sendCommandMessage
We can send command messages to the Elsa-Heart directly using this functionality.<br>
`sendCommandMessage` requires an instance of the `DatabaseReference` and a `message`as arguments. <br>
Here is the basic example of the usage.<br>
```kotlin
private val databaseReference = fireBaseDatabase.reference

... // skip body // ...

val command = result.replace(commanderName, "").trim()
sendCommandMessage(databaseReference, command)
```

### Overview
Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality. Whether we're creating server-side, desktop or mobile applications, it's important that we provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective, but scalable when needed.
